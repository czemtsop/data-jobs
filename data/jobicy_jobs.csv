This is a high-autonomy, high-impact individual contributor role that supports our Head of Finance in partnering with the exec team on forward-looking analysis that drives real decisions.</h4>
<p>We’re a SaaS platform, so metrics like MRR, LTV, CAC, and activation are core to how we operate. If those are second nature to you, keep reading. You’ll connect the dots between those levers and their revenue impact—turning pricing, retention, and growth signals into forecasts the business can actually use. You’ll also work closely with our Data team to uplevel how we use metrics to guide the business.</p>
<h2><strong>Your support system</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll report to Anthony Wakim, our Head of Finance. He’ll help you ramp, set context, and be a sounding board—but this role is all about ownership. You’ll lead forecasting, reporting, and decision support from the start.</p>
<p>We keep our in-house finance team lean (just two people), but you’ll have strong external partners on accounting and ops. You’ll also have access to our full finance stack (Runway, Stripe, Quicksite, QuickBooks), and tight collaboration with Product, Sales, Marketing, and Data.</p>
<h2><strong>What you’ll do</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First week: </strong>Get oriented on Kit’s business model, customer segments, and SaaS metrics. Meet your manager and key partners across Product, Marketing, Sales, and Data. Audit our existing reports, forecasts, and dashboards. Shadow our monthly forecasting cycle. Complete a quick breakeven analysis to support pricing and margin decisions.</li>
<li><strong>First month:</strong> Start contributing to forecast updates. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to refine assumptions, track trends, and sharpen insights. Support exec-level financial narratives and scenario modeling to guide key business decisions.</li>
<li><strong>First six months: </strong>Partner with Data to level up finance dashboards. Build models that map growth levers—like activation, retention, pricing, and CAC efficiency—directly to revenue and profitability. Run pricing simulations, model activation improvements on MRR and retention, and assess plan-level margin across customer segments.</li>
<li><strong>First year:</strong> Help evolve Kit’s operating model to support scale. Maintain financial frameworks that connect metrics to revenue, headcount, and unit economics. Partner with the Head of Finance to strengthen forecast accuracy and decision-making tools. Support GTM strategy through CAC payback modeling, discounting analysis, and performance insights across channels and segments.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What will set you up for success</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve built your own forecasting models—and know how to pressure test them</li>

<li>You communicate clearly and turn complex data into compelling stories</li>
<li>You thrive in fast-moving, high-autonomy environments</li>

<li>Bonus: You’re comfortable writing SQL to pull and explore your own data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>7+ years in FP&amp;A, strategic finance, or an adjacent analytical role</li>
<li>Deep knowledge of SaaS metrics and how growth levers affect the P&amp;L, ideally gained in a growth-stage or recurring revenue company</li>
<li>Comfortable collaborating across Product, Marketing, Sales, and Data</li>
<li>You’ve presented to execs and built tools (like pricing calculators or retention models) that influenced business decisions</li>
<li>Bonus: You’ve implemented or scaled FP&amp;A platforms like Runway, Mosaic, or Pigment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’re analytical, curious, and want to understand how everything connects</li>
<li>You’re dependable, proactive, and take full ownership from analysis to outcome</li>
<li>You’re a strong partner—collaborative, communicative, and follow through</li>
<li>You like structure, but you don’t need it—you’re energized by ambiguity and open-ended challenges</li>

<p>We’re a distributed company with more than 1700 Automatticians in 92 countries speaking 110+ different languages. And, even more than growth and profitability (although we’re plenty profitable), above all, we’re driven by a mission:  We democratize publishing and commerce so anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone with a product can sell it, regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or country.</p>
<h2><strong>Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion at Automattic</strong></h2>
<p>We’re improving diversity in the tech industry. At Automattic, we want people to love their work and show respect and empathy to all. We welcome differences and strive to increase participation from traditionally underrepresented groups. Our DEI committee involves Automatticians across the company and drives grassroots change. For example, this group has helped facilitate private online spaces for affiliated Automatticians to gather and helps run a monthly DEI People Lab series for further learning. DEI is a priority at Automattic, though our dedication influences far more than just Automatticians: We make our products freely available and translate our products into and offer customer support in numerous languages. We require unconscious bias training for our hiring teams and ensure our products are accessible across different bandwidths and devices.</p>
